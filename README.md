This project investigates the potential link between internet access quality and a country's Gross National Product (GNP). We hypothesize that countries with good quality internet will exhibit significantly higher average GNP compared to those with limited or poor internet access.

Methodology:

1. Data Acquisition: We will gather cross-country data on internet quality as factors and GNP for a representative sample of countries.
2. Identify a statistically significant difference in average GNP between countries with good-quality internet and those with poor-quality internet.
3. Provide data-driven evidence for the potential role of internet access in promoting economic growth.

Potential Explanations:

1. Information's Impact on Macroeconomic Tools:
High-quality internet access facilitates the flow of information, essential for effective economic decision-making. Businesses can access global markets, compare prices, and identify new investment opportunities. Policymakers can analyze economic trends and formulate data-driven policies to promote growth. Additionally, citizens can access financial services and manage investments more efficiently.

2. Increased Commerce Demand Generation:
The Internet fosters e-commerce and online marketplaces, allowing businesses to reach broader customer bases, both domestically and internationally. This can stimulate demand for goods and services, leading to increased production, employment opportunities, and overall economic activity. Improved logistics and supply chain management facilitated by the Internet further contribute to efficiency and economic growth.

3. Increase in Income Due to Education:
The Internet provides access to a vast array of educational resources, allowing individuals to acquire new skills and knowledge. This can lead to a more skilled and productive workforce, potentially commanding higher wages. Educational opportunities online can also empower individuals to pursue entrepreneurial ventures or remote work, contributing to increased incomes and overall economic well-being.
